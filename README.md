# homeserver-spec-versions

## About

This repo contains raw data and simple web UI for https://patrick.cloke.us/homeserver-spec-versions/.

It aims to provide some information related to the [Matrix specficiation](https://spec.matrix.org/):

1. When each homeserver started (and stopped) supporting each version of the spec.
2. The latency from a spec version being released to homeservers supporting it.
3. The correlation between the amount of time between spec versions and the amount of time it took a homeserver to support that version after release.

It also contain some information specific to [room versions](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.10/rooms/):

1. When each homeserver started (and stopped) supporting each room version.
2. When each homeserver declared a room version as the "default" room version.

Separately there's also a timeline of homeservers (considering their first and
latest commits) and information about forks, forming a family tree of homeservers.

Note that this repository deals with homeserver implementations and not particular deployments.
